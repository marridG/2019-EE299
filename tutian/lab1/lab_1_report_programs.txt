[Part 1]

Program 1: Modify the program so that LED is on for 2 seconds and off for 1 second and
repeats.

Program 2: Modify the program so that the LED has two 1 second blinks followed by two
2 second blinks and repeats.

Programs 3 and 4: Working from the sample code in the Cookbook and the code you
developed in the previous exercise, modify Programs 1 and 2 to blink the LED Brick rather 
than the onboard LED. Develop the software, compile, and download it to the target. Verify
the proper operation for each program. 

Program 5: Starting with the Electronic_Bricks_Starter_Kit_Cookbook under documentation
on the class webpage, now connect the Button Brick and the LED Brick to the
microcontroller. Develop the software, compile, and download it to the target. Verify that
the LED Brick can be controlled by the Button Brick.

Program 6: Starting with the working C code, hw1.ino, in folder for this project, compile and
download the program. When the program has completed downloading,
Select
â€¢ Tools
o Serial Monitor
A small window will open. Verify that the program is properly printing in that window. 

Program 7: Starting with the working C code, hw1.ino and your working C code for
homework assignment problem 1, modify the code for hw1.ino to incorporate your code for
homework problem 1. The main change will be modifying any of your printf lines to the
proper combinations of,
Serial.print("stuff to print");
Serial.println("stuff to print followed by new line");

[Part 2]

Program 1: Compile and download the program to the Arduino. Verify that the program is executing and
properly displaying the Hello World message. 

Program 2: Modify the program to print the first
name of each lab partner. Print two names on the first row of the display and one on the
second. 

Program 3: Print a "X"

Program 4: Two buttons controlling "X"

Program 5: Communication
